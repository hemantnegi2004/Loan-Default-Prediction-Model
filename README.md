# Loan-Default-Prediction-Model
Built a machine learning model to predict loan defaults using given data. Preprocessed and engineered features, trained the model, and evaluated performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score. Applied the model to the test dataset to generate predictions, helping financial institutions assess loan risk and make data-driven lending decisions.
