# Loan-Default-Prediction-Model
This project involves building and training a machine learning model to predict loan defaults using a given dataset. The workflow includes:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the loan data for better model performance.
Feature Engineering: Selecting and creating relevant features to improve predictions.
Model Training: Applying machine learning algorithms to train a predictive model using the training dataset.
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Predictions: Applying the trained model to the test dataset to generate loan default predictions.
Ths project aims to assist financial institutions in assessing loan risk and making data-driven lending decisions.
